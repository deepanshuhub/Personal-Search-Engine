# Personal-Search-Engine
The Personal Search Engine (AI-based) is an impressive Python project that leverages the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to deliver personalized search outcomes to users, tailored specifically to their queries. By employing advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, this system intelligently analyzes the user's query and retrieves relevant search results from the vast expanse of the web. With the integration of GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) technology, this project takes search functionality to the next level, enabling users to obtain highly accurate and customized information. The utilization of GPT as a reference key enhances the system's ability to understand and respond to user queries in a more efficient and effective manner. Overall, this project showcases the synergy between AI, NLP, and GPT, empowering users with a more personalized and intuitive search experience.
